Once in place, these measures apply to anyone with access to official information. Information Classification is a mandatory requirement for all New Zealand Government Agencies.\n\nThe SDLT will ask you to describe the information you are classifying, then a series of questions about that information. Based on the information and answers provided, the SDLT will generate an Information Classification for you. This classification will be generated with an audit of why it has been classified like this.\n\nFor more information about Information Classification, please visit: https:\/\/www.digital.govt.nz\/",

The information doesn\u2019t need to identify a person by their name to be personal information, and it also doesn\u2019t need to be private or sensitive. As long as there\u2019s a reasonable chance that someone could be identified from the information - even if it\u2019s only one person that makes the link between the information and the individual, and even if it\u2019s only by linking it with other information - then it\u2019s personal information. This includes information about other staff members and our customers.<\/p><p>All systems created, managed and used by the Agency that contain or use any form of Personal Information must go through a Privacy Threshold Assessment process. At the end of this questionnaire, a Privacy Threshold Assessment task will be completed. When completed, this task will be submitted to the Privacy Officers for review and approval.<\/p><p>For more information, and specific examples, please see the Privacy Page on OnRamp: https:\/\/onramp.example.co.nz\/what-we-do\/legal-services\/privacy\/<\/p>",
