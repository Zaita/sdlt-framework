This was problematic, as it required in-depth knowledge of potential consequences to the Agency. Many times, the delivery team did not have enough familiarity with the Agency to adequately determine potential consequences.</p><p>The Security team have worked to classify the Transport Agency systems based on criticality and potential impacts in the event of a security incident. This new pre-classification is used as the 'Impact' level when assigning risks to deliverables.

Previously, the Transport Agency would engage an external vendor to undertake the CVA. This process has been time consuming and expensive. The new DSRA process is going to rely firstly on self-attestation by the delivery team, with manual audits undertaken based on residual risk levels.</p><p>The CVA task will provide a list of controls that are to be implemented. You will need to determine what controls are applicable to your deliverable; and what controls you want to implement to lower your risk rating. Each control implemented will lower the likelihood and impact ratings for your deliverable. You can see the amount of reduction each control has in the Digital Security Risk Assessment task.</p><p>Within the CVA, you will see a list of controls, a plain English description of what that control is and why it's important, and some implementation guidance on how to implement it within the context of the Transport Agency and it's Enterprise Architecture. By changing the implementation status of each control to wither 'Yes', 'No' or 'Not Applicable' and selecting 'Submit'; you will cause the DSRA to automatically update it's values providing a live view of the current risk for your deliverable.</p><p>As part of your delivery it is recommended that you go through the Control Validation Task first to mark all of the controls ""Not Applicable"" that do not apply. This will give you a list of controls that will be scored in the DSRA allowing you to shop-down risk.</p><p><strong>Note: The controls will not show up in the DSRA until you go into the Control Validation Audit at least once and click the ""Submit"" button at the very bottom. </strong></p>","action",0,116,52

The information doesn’t need to identify a person by their name to be personal information, and it also doesn’t need to be private or sensitive. As long as there’s a reasonable chance that someone could be identified from the information - even if it’s only one person that makes the link between the information and the individual, and even if it’s only by linking it with other information - then it’s personal information. This includes information about other staff members and our customers.</p><p>All SaaS products used by the Agency that contain or use any form of Personal Information must go through a Privacy Threshold Assessment process. At the end of this questionnaire, a Privacy Threshold Assessment task will be completed. When completed, this task will be submitted to the Privacy Officers for review and approval.</p><p>For more information, and specific examples, please see the Privacy Page on OnRamp: https://onramp.example.co.nz/what-we-do/legal-services/privacy/</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If the product will only store the names and email addresses of Transport Agency staff as users of this system, please click the ""Agency Staff Login Only"" button.</p>","action",2,182,0
